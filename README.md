## Introduction

**POWERBACK** draws inspiration from the `#ForceTheVote` movement of 2021, which challenged members of Congress to demand a vote on `Medicare For All`. This platform takes the concept further, allowing users to harness their collective power to promote accountability from our representatives.

**POWERBACK** is a digital revolution for wherever political corruption has become the new normal. We are not and will never be affiliated with any political party or individual candidate. Instead, **POWERBACK** focuses on serving voters, citizens, and regular people like you who just want their voices heard.

## How POWERBACK Works

**POWERBACK's** operation is simple yet impactful:

1. Search for House `Representatives` who matter to you.

2. Create a `Celebration` agreement. This commitment means that **POWERBACK** will safeguard and deliver a prepaid campaign donation on your behalf, to the House congressional candidate of your choice, if and when `Medicare For All` **is brought to the House floor for a vote**.

3. Choose your campaign donation amount, and proceed with payment. For larger amounts, **POWERBACK** ensure proper filing with the [FEC](https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/how-to-research-public-records/individual-contributions/), providing this service to you for free. (Learn more at the [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md))

4. Your voice is heard, and you contribute to the cause you care about.

- You must be `18 years old` to donate. Read more at the [Eligibility requirements](./docs/ELIGIBILITY.md).

## Our Values

- **Low Fees:** Our fees are the lowest out there, ensuring that democracy doesn't need to pay a premium. Virtually all fees are to cover the payment processing service, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Learn more about these fees at the [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md).

- **No Profits:** This is not a for-profit organization. **POWERBACK** relies on user and public support to continue our mission. You can make a difference by giving a Tip along with your `Celebrations`, or by giving directly via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/powerback). You can also send **Bitcoin** at
