## General

### What is POWERBACK?

**POWERBACK** is an election campaign donation service with a fresh approach for small-dollar donors, inspired by the 2021 `#ForceTheVote` movement. This movement encouraged House members to demand a vote on `Medicare For All`.

In the spirit of commitment, accountability, and healthcare as a human right, **POWERBACK** carries this concept into the fundraising world. We harness contributions from everyday people to celebrate politicians that honor your values.

### Why make my political contributions with POWERBACK?

**POWERBACK** stands out among online services that facilitate political donations. We are distinct because we exist for voters, citizens, and ordinary individuals, not as a tool for any specific politician claiming to represent you.

No politician will get a single cent of any contribution through our service until `Medicare For All` is called for a vote. Our focus is on your voice and your impact.

### How does POWERBACK work?

It's simple.

- Use our search options to find `Representatives` who matter to you.
- Select who you'd like to make a `Celebration` with (defined below) to honor your campaign donation when `Medicare For All` is brought to the House floor for a vote.
- Then choose your `Celebration` amount and proceed with payment. For amounts exceeding `$200` in a single campaign cycle, we ensure proper filing with the [FEC](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/other-filers/), and this service is offered to you free of charge.

Your voice matters.

## Celebrations

### What is a Celebration?

A `Celebration` is a heartfelt commitment. When you make yours, **POWERBACK** holds it to be delivered to the intended campaign **if and only if `Medicare For All` is brought to the House floor for a vote**. Celebrations are not tied to any individual lawmaker's actions, but instead the occurrence of a roll-call vote as a legislative event, _regardless of the outcome_.

### What does POWERBACK charge?

`2.9%` plus `30 cents` per `Celebration` for our payment processing service, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/pricing). Other services may charge a `3.95%` flat fee, which is cheaper by a difference of cents for donations up until around `$29`, after which we increasingly price out all known competitors! Our goal is to ensure your support is impactful, while we keep the lights on.

### Can I give to challengers or only incumbents?

Our strategy is to bolster whomever holds office now to start representing you today. In this sense, **POWERBACK** may encourage incumbency as a side effect, but only to the degree that incumbents serve the people during their terms. Failure here may prove to be a benefit for savvy challengers.

### Does POWERBACK cover other bills, the Senate, or local elections?

Currently, we focus only on the cause of `Medicare For All`. However, with [your support](https://patreon.com/powerback), we plan to expand our reach to other vital issues and elections in the near future. [Your support](https://patreon.com/powerback) can help us make a broader impact.

## Transparency

### What do you do with my data?

Your trust is sacred. **POWERBACK** will never sell or unilaterally share your data with persons, entities, political parties, government agencies, or fundraising organizations.

`Celebration` milestones achieved across our userbase may be shared with the intended election campaign recipients, the press and the public, highlighting the collective voice you're creating.

### What is a Cosponsor?

A `Cosponsor` is an elected representative who has pledged their name in support for a `Bill` i.e. piece of legislation. There are no rules in Congress for who may cosponsor what, but cosponsorships typically follow party lines.

### Does POWERBACK have any party or corporate affiliation?

No, we're independent. **POWERBACK** is committed to neutrality and serving the interests of the people, free from any party or corporate affiliation. For example, we always display politicians in a random sequence to prevent favoritism.

### Is POWERBACK a non-profit?

Yes. We rely entirely on user and [public support](https://patreon.com/powerback). Consider giving a `Tip` along with your `Celebration` when prompted.

And please share the word about **POWERBACK** with your friends, family, neighbors, and fellow Americans. Together, we make a difference.
